import JSONGrapher 


##STEP 1:  Launch JSONGrapher with a single line!
final_plots_record_list = JSONGrapher.launch()


#Now just drag records in!


#The rest of this file is simply a suggested order and also demonstrates merging records!

##STEP 2: Try dragging in UAN_DTA_8.json and UAN_DTA_6.json to see two graphs plotted together.

##STEP 3: Click "Clear Files List", then drag in O_OH_Scaling.json to see a fancy graph.
##STEP 4: Click "Clear Files List", then drag in SrTiO3_rainbow.json to see a fancy graph.

#Please note that the below 3 Graphs can be generated by equations instead of data. See the later examples.
##STEP 5: Click "Clear Files List", then drag in Rate_Constant_mesh3d.json to see a 3D surface plot 
##STEP 6: Click "Clear Files List", then drag in Rate_Constant_scatter3d_edited.json to see a 3D scatter plot 
##STEP 7: Click "Clear Files List", then drag in Rate_Constant_bubble.json to see a bubble plot 

##STEP 8: Click "Clear Files List", then drag in LaMnO3.json and LaFeO3.json
##STEP 9: Click "End", this will return the merged record of the final plot.


#The ability to merge records, even from different starting units, is one of the major features of JSONGrapher.
#The final_plot_record is the first item in the final_plot_records_list. It combines all the data (all series) from in the most recent plot into one JSONGrapher Record.

final_plot_record = final_plots_record_list[0]
#print(final_plots_record_list[0])
final_plot_record.export_to_json_file("Combined_Record.json")

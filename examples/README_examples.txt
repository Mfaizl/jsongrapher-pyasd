Each directory has a separate example with the python file to run beginning with the word "example"

example_1_drag_and_drop shows how to launch a JSONGrapher window for dragging and dropping in multiple files for merging and plotting.

example_2_creating_records_and_using_styles provides a tutorial like example on how to make JSONGrapher records and apply styles (layout_style and trace_styles_collection)

example_3_online_simulation_call shows an example where the json record calls JavaScript source code from online to simulate and populate a dataseries.

example_4_custom_units shows an example where custom units are used.

example_5_equation_plotting shows an example where an equation with units is entered from python commands and plotted.

example_6_equation_alongside_data shows an example where equations with units are loaded from JSONGrapher records and plotted alongside datapoints.

example_7_custom_formatting_and_style_extraction shows an example of how to apply formatting as well as how to make, extract and use styles (layout_style and trace_style)

example_8_custom_formatting_advanced of how to further customize the formatting of individual traces, which can be used to make styles.

example_9_scatter3d_and_mesh3d_plots shows an example of 3D plots (both scatter3d and mesh3d, where there latter is a surface plot)

example_10_bubble_plot shows an example of how to create a bubble plot, which is another kind of 3D plot.

example_11_local_python_call shows an example where the json record calls a local python function to simulate and populate a dataseries. This feature requires the user's script to call the feature, for security reasons. The JSON record cannot call functions "by itself".
